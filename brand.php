<h3>Mission</h3>
Eye candy cosmetics specializes in creating homemade cosmetics with love. &hearts; We are a cruelty free brand that cherishes 
creativity and self-expression through makeup. We believe makeup is gender neutral and cater to literally <strong style="color:teal;">EVERYONE </strong> &hearts;.
 We have products
for every skin tone, and skin type. Making products that are inclusive and universal is very important to us because 
we recognize the lack of diversity in this current beauty industry. These big companies need to recognize there are more than 
3 shades for people of color.
<p>
Eyecandy Cosmetics are carefully curated to be cruelty-free &hearts;. We <strong style="color:teal;"> LOVE </strong> animals and do not support animal testing what so ever!
Unlike big companies such as Nars, M.A.C, Makeup Revolution, Benefit, and Clinique are just a sample of the many that unfortunately
tests on animals. But we do not which makes us unique. 
 Hope you enjoy!
